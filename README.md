### Description:
Paws For Alarm consolidates listings for animals at risk of euthanasia. As a secondary goal, it endorses animals in need of foster homes. <br>
The app supports manual entry by an admin, but primarily sources information from the RescueGroups.org API.<br>
PFA has an interface to support adding new animals and updating information each time data is ingested from external sources.<br>
Users can view all available animals, or filter results (by species, location, and organizational group).<br><br>

### Setup:
Create a virtual environment. <br>
Install the items in requirements.txt <br>
You will need to request an API key from RescueGroups.org.<br>
To use the manual entry features, you'll need to generate an authentication token.<br>
Additionally, a password is used for code implemented to prevent CSRF attacks- this will need to be generated.<br><br>

When the site launches and the API key use changes, this may be updated.<br>

    <h3>FAQ </h3> <br>

    <h6>Q: What is the goal of your site? </h6>
    <text> A: The starting vision was to consolidate adoption posts for animals that are at risk of euthanasia. <br>
        While this is still the main goal, the site also now promotes animals that are in need of a foster home. <br>
    </text> <br>

    <h6>Q: How do you determine which animals are at risk of euthanasia, or need to be fostered? </h6>
    <text> A: A portion of the animals on the site have euthanasia dates, per data provided by RescueGroups.org's API.  <br>
        Please note that this list <i> is not exhaustive</i>; some shelters don't enter information into RescueGroups.org. <br>
        In the case of animals in need of foster, shelter groups can flag animals as such. </text> <br><br>

    <h6>Q: Why is an animal's listed euthanasia date in the past? </h6>
    <text> A: There are many potential answers for this. <br> An animal may be in foster care; if so, their date might not be updated in records. <br>
        Another explanation is that the animal is no longer available.  </text> <br><br>

    <h6>Q: What animals will be on this site? </h6>
    <text> A: The main animal results are of cats and dogs, but other animal types are supported as well. </text> <br> <br>

    <!-- update when api is formalized -->
    <h6>Q: How is the site updated?  </h6>
    <text> A: The information is compiled using manual requests from an API. <br>
        Ultimately, there may be more regular, automatic updates. </text> <br> <br>
